<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> thing.  We urge you to try our program, for nothing will be so helpful to your husband as the radically changed attitude toward him which God will show you how to have.  Go along with your husband if you possibly can.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you and your husband find a solution for the pressing problem of drink you are, of course, going to be very happy.  But all problems will not be solved at once.  Seed has started to sprout in a new soil, but growth has only begun.  In spite of your new-found happiness, there will be ups and downs.  Many of the old problems will still be with you.  This is as it should be.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The faith and sincerity of both you and your husband will be put to the test.  These work-outs should be regarded as part of your education, for thus you will be learning to live.  You will make mistakes, but if you are in earnest they will not drag you down.  Instead, you will capitalize them.  A better way of life will emerge when they are overcome.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some of the snags you will encounter are irritation, hurt feelings and resentments.  Your husband will sometimes be unreasonable and you will want to criticize.  Starting from a speck on the domestic horizon, great thunderclouds of dispute may gather.  These family dissensions are very dangerous, especially to your husband.  Often you must carry the burden of avoiding them or keeping them under control.  Never forget that resentment is a deadly hazard to an alcoholic.  We do not mean that you have to agree with your husband whenever there is an honest difference of opinion.  Just be careful not to disagree in a resentful or critical spirit.</P>
