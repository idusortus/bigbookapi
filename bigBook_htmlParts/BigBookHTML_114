<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are exceptions.  Some men have been so impaired by alcohol that they cannot stop.  Sometimes there are cases where alcoholism is complicated by other disorders.  A good doctor or psychiatrist can tell you whether these complications are serious.  In any event, try to have your husband read this book.  His reaction may be one of enthusiasm.  If he is already committed to an institution, but can convince you and your doctor that he means business, give him a chance to try our method, unless the doctor thinks his mental condition too abnormal or dangerous.  We make this recommendation with some confidence.  For years we have been working with alcoholics committed to institutions.  Since this book was first published, A.A. has released thousands of alcoholics from asylums and hospitals of every kind.  The majority have never returned.  The power of God goes deep!</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You may have the reverse situation on your hands.  Perhaps you have a husband who is at large, but who should be committed.  Some men cannot or will not get over alcoholism.  When they become too dangerous, we think the kind thing is to lock them up, but of course a good doctor should always be consulted.  The wives and children of such men suffer horribly, but not more than the men themselves.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But sometimes you must start life anew.  We know women who have done it.  If such women adopt a spiritual way of life their road will be smoother.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If your husband is a drinker, you probably worry over what other people are thinking and you hate to meet your friends.  You draw more and more into yourself and you think everyone is talking about conditions at your home.  You avoid the subject of drinking,</P>
