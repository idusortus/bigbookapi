Those of us belonging to a religious denomination which requires confession must, and of course, will want to go to the properly appointed authority whose duty it is to receive it.  Though we have no religious connection, we may still do well to talk with someone ordained by an established religion.  We often find such a person quick to see and understand our problem.  Of course, we sometimes encounter people who do not understand alcoholics.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we cannot or would rather not do this, we search our acquaintance for a close-mouthed, understanding friend.  Perhaps our doctor or psychologist will be the person.  It may be one of our own family, but we cannot disclose anything to our wives or our parents which will hurt them and make them unhappy.  We have no right to save our own skin at another person's expense.  Such parts of our story we tell to someone who will understand, yet be unaffected.  The rule is we must be hard on ourself, but always considerate of others.</P>

If that is so, this step may be postponed, only, however, if we hold ourselves in complete readiness to go through with it at the first opportunity.  We say this because we are very anxious that we talk to the right person.  It is important that he be able to keep a confidence; that he fully understand and approve what we are driving at;</P>
