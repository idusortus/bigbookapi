<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We realize that we have been giving you much direction and advice.  We may have seemed to lecture.  If that is so we are sorry, for we ourselves don't always care for people who lecture us.  But what we have related is based upon experience, some of it painful.  We had to learn these things the hard way.  That is why we are anxious that you understand, and that you avoid these unnecessary difficulties. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So to you out there - who may soon be with us - we say &quot;Good luck and God bless you!&quot;</P>
