<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Usually the family should not try to tell your story.  When possible, avoid meeting a man through his family.  Approach through a doctor or an institution is a better bet.  If your man needs hospitalization, he should have it, but not forcibly unless he is violent.  Let the doctor, if he will, tell him he has something in the way of a solution.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When your man is better, the doctor might suggest a visit from you.  Though you have talked with the family, leave them out of the first discussion.  Under these conditions your prospect will see he is under no pressure.  He will feel he can deal with you without being nagged by his family.  Call on him while he is still jittery.  He may be more receptive when depressed.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">See your man alone, if possible.  At first engage in general conversation.  After a while, turn the talk to some phase of drinking.  Tell him enough about your drinking habits, symptoms, and experiences to encourage him to speak of himself.  If he wishes to talk, let him do so.  You will thus get a better idea of how you ought to proceed.  If he is not communicative, give him a sketch of your drinking career up to the time you quit.  But say nothing, for the moment, of how that was accomplished.  If he is in a serious mood dwell on the troubles liquor has caused you, being careful not to moralize or lecture.  If his mood is light, tell him humorous stories of your escapades.  Get him to tell some of his.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When he sees you know all about the drinking game, commence to describe yourself as an alcoholic.</P>
