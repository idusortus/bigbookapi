<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unless your friend wants to talk further about himself, do not wear out your welcome.  Give him a chance to think it over.  If you do stay, let him steer the conversation in any direction he likes.  Sometimes a new man is anxious to proceed at once. And you may be tempted to let him do so.  This is sometimes a mistake.  If he has trouble later, he is likely to say you rushed him.  You will be most successful with alcoholics if you do not exhibit any passion for crusade or reform.  Never talk down to an alcoholic from any moral or spiritual hilltop; simply lay out the kit of spiritual tools for his inspection.  Show him how they worked with you.  Offer him friendship and fellowship.  Tell him that if he wants to get well you will do anything to help.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If he is not interested in your solution, if he expects you to act only as a banker for his financial difficulties or a nurse for his sprees, you may have to drop him until he changes his mind.  This he may do after he gets hurt some more.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If he is sincerely interested and wants to see you again, ask him to read this book in the interval.  After doing that, he must decide for himself whether he wants to go on.  He should not be pushed or prodded by you, his wife, or his friends.  If he is to find God, the desire must come from within.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If he thinks he can do the job in some other way, or prefers some other spiritual approach, encourage him to follow his own conscience.  We have no monopoly on God; we merely have an approach that worked with us.  But point out that we alcoholics have much in common and that you would like, in any case, to be friendly.  Let it go at that.</P>
