<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> employer can many times protect the victim from this kind of talk.  The employer cannot play favorites, but he can always defend a man from needless provocation and unfair criticism.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a class, alcoholics are energetic people.  They work hard and they play hard.  Your man should be on his mettle to make good.  Being somewhat weakened, and faced with physical and mental readjustment to a life which knows no alcohol, he may overdo.  You may have to curb his desire to work sixteen hours a day.  You may need to encourage him to play once in a while.  He may wish to do a lot for other alcoholics and something of the sort may come up during business hours.  A reasonable amount of latitude will be helpful.  This work is necessary to maintain his sobriety.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After your man has gone along without drinking for a few months, you may be able to make use of his services with other employees who are giving you the alcoholic run-around - provided, of course, they are willing to have a third party in the picture.  An alcoholic who has recovered, but holds a relatively unimportant job, can talk to a man with a better position.  Being on a radically different basis of life, he will never take advantage of the situation.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Your man may be trusted.  Long experience with alcoholic excuses naturally arouses suspicion.  When his wife next calls saying he is sick, you might jump to the conclusion he is drunk.  If he is, and is still trying to recover, he will tell you about it even if it means the loss of his job.  For he knows he must be honest if he would live at all.  He will appreciate knowing you are not bothering your head about him,</P>
