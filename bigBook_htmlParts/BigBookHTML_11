<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To Christ I conceded the certainty of a great man, not too closely followed by those who claimed Him.  His moral teaching - most excellent.  For myself, I had adopted those parts which seemed convenient and not too difficult; the rest I disregarded.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The wars which had been fought, the burnings and chicanery that religious dispute had facilitated, made me sick.  I honestly doubted whether, on balance, the religions of mankind had done any good.  Judging from what I had seen in Europe and since, the power of God in human affairs was negligible, the Brotherhood of Man a grim jest.  If there was a Devil, he seemed the Boss Universal, and he certainly had me.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But my friend sat before me, and he made the point-blank declaration that God had done for him what he could not do for himself.  His human will had failed.  Doctors had pronounced him incurable.  Society was about to lock him up.  Like myself, he had admitted complete defeat.  Then he had, in effect, been raised from the dead, suddenly taken from the scrap heap to a level of life better than the best he had ever known!</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Had this power originated in him?  Obviously it had not.  There had been no more power in him than there was in me at the minute; and this was none at all.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That floored me.  It began to look as though religious people were right after all.  Here was something at work in a human heart which had done the impossible.  My ideas about miracles were drastically revised right then.  Never mind the musty past; here sat a miracle directly across the kitchen table.  He shouted great tidings.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I saw that my friend was much more than inwardly</P>
