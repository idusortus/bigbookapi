<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">  Maybe we are divorced, and have remarried but haven't kept up the alimony to number one.  She is indignant about it, and has a warrant out for our arrest.  That's a common form of trouble too.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although these reparations take innumerable forms, there are some general principles which we find guiding.  Reminding ourselves that we have decided to go to any lengths to find a spiritual experience, we ask that we be given strength and direction to do the right thing, no matter what the personal consequences may be.  We may lose our position or reputation or face jail, but we are willing.  We have to be.  We must not shrink at anything.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Usually, however, other people are involved.  Therefore, we are not to be the hasty and foolish martyr who would needlessly sacrifice others to save himself from the alcoholic pit.  A man we know had remarried.  Because of resentment and drinking, he had not paid alimony to his first wife.  She was furious.  She went to court and got an order for his arrest.  He had commenced our way of life, had secured a position, and was getting his head above water.  It would have been impressive heroics if he had walked up to the Judge and said, &quot;Here I am.&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We thought he ought to be willing to do that if necessary, but if he were in jail he could provide nothing for either family.  We suggested he write his first wife admitting his faults and asking forgiveness.  He did, and also sent a small amount of money.  He told her what he would try to do in the future.  He said he was perfectly willing to go to jail if she insisted.  Of course she did not, and the whole situation has long since been adjusted.</P>
