<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> though it emanate from our best minds.  What about people who proved that man could never fly?</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yet we had been seeing another kind of flight, a spiritual liberation from this world, people who rose above their problems.  They said God made these things possible, and we only smiled.  We had seen spiritual release, but liked to tell ourselves it wasn't true.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Actually we were fooling ourselves, for deep down in every man, woman, and child, is the fundamental idea of God.  It may be obscured by calamity, by pomp, by worship of other things, but in some form or other it is there.  For faith in a Power greater than ourselves, and miraculous demonstrations of that power in human lives, are facts as old as man himself.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We finally saw that faith in some kind of God was a part of our make-up, just as much as the feeling we have for a friend.  Sometimes we had to search fearlessly, but He was there.  He was as much a fact as we were.  We found the Great Reality deep down within us.  In the last analysis it is only there that He may be found.  It was so with us.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We can only clear the ground a bit.  If our testimony helps sweep away prejudice, enables you to think honestly, encourages you to search diligently within yourself, then, if you wish, you can join us on the Broad Highway.  With this attitude you cannot fail.  The consciousness of your belief is sure to come to you.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In this book you will read the experience of a man who thought he was an atheist.  His story is so interesting that some of it should be told now.  His change of heart was dramatic, convincing, and moving.</P>
