<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we can answer to our satisfaction, we then look at <I>Step Six.  </I>We have emphasized willingness as being indispensable.  Are we now ready to let God remove from us all the things which we have admitted are objectionable?  Can He now take them all - every one?  If we still cling to something we will not let go, we ask God to help us be willing.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When ready, we say something like this: &quot;My Creator, I am now willing that you should have all of me, good and bad.  I pray that you now remove from me every single defect of character which stands in the way of my usefulness to you and my fellows.  Grant me strength, as I go out from here, to do your bidding.  Amen.&quot; We have then completed <I>Step Seven.</P>
</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Now we need more action, without which we find that &quot;Faith without works is dead.&quot; Let's look at <I>Steps Eight and Nine.</I>  We have a list of all persons we have harmed and to whom we are willing to make amends.  We made it when we took inventory.  We subjected ourselves to a drastic self-appraisal.  Now we go out to our fellows and repair the damage done in the past.  We attempt to sweep away the debris which has accumulated out of our effort to live on self-will and run the show ourselves.  If we haven't the will to do this, we ask until it comes.  Remember it was agreed at the beginning <I>we would go to any lengths for victory over alcohol.</P>
</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Probably there are still some misgivings.  As we look over the list of business acquaintances and friends we have hurt, we may feel diffident about going to some of them on a spiritual basis.  Let us be reassured.  To some people we need not, and probably should not emphasize the spiritual feature on our first approach.</P><P align=right><a href="Page_77.htm"><img src="next.gif" alt="Next Page" border="0" width="67" height="21"></A></P></body></HTML>
