<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> can be accomplished until we do so, never trying to tell him what he should do.  His faults are not discussed.  We stick to our own.  If our manner is calm, frank, and open, we will be gratified with the result.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In nine cases out of ten the unexpected happens.  Sometimes the man we are calling upon admits his own fault, so feuds of years' standing melt away in an hour.  Rarely do we fail to make satisfactory progress.  Our former enemies sometimes praise what we are doing and wish us well.  Occasionally, they will offer assistance.  It should not matter, however, if someone does throw us out of his office.  We have made our demonstration, done our part.  It's water over the dam.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Most alcoholics owe money.  We do not dodge our creditors.  Telling them what we are trying to do, we make no bones about our drinking; they usually know it anyway, whether we think so or not.  Nor are we afraid of disclosing our alcoholism on the theory it may cause financial harm.  Approached in this way, the most ruthless creditor will sometimes surprise us.  Arranging the best deal we can we let these people know we are sorry.  Our drinking has made us slow to pay.  We must lose our fear of creditors no matter how far we have to go, for we are liable to drink if we are afraid to face them.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Perhaps we have committed a criminal offense which might land us in jail if it were known to the authorities.  We may be short in our accounts and unable to make good.  We have already admitted this in confidence to another person, but we are sure we would be imprisoned or lose our job if it were known.  Maybe it's only a petty offense such as padding the expense account.  Most of us have done that sort of thing.</P>
