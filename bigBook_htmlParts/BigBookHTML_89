<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT SIZE=+2>P</FONT>ractical experience shows that nothing will so much insure immunity from drinking as intensive work with other alcoholics.  It works when other activities fail.  This is our <I>twelfth suggestion</I>: Carry this message to other alcoholics!  You can help when no one else can.  You can secure their confidence when others fail.  Remember they are very ill.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Life will take on new meaning.  To watch people recover, to see them help others, to watch loneliness vanish, to see a fellowship grow up about you, to have a host of friends - this is an experience you must not miss.  We know you will not want to miss it.  Frequent contact with newcomers and with each other is the bright spot of our lives.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Perhaps you are not acquainted with any drinkers who want to recover.  You can easily find some by asking a few doctors, ministers, priests or hospitals.  They will be only too glad to assist you.  Don't start out as an evangelist or reformer.  Unfortunately a lot of prejudice exists.  You will be handicapped if you arouse it.  Ministers and doctors are competent and you can learn much from them if you wish, but it happens that because of your own drinking experience you can be uniquely useful to other alcoholics.  So cooperate; never criticize.  To be helpful is our only aim.</P>
