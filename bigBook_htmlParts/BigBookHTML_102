<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> places?&quot; If you answer these questions satisfactorily, you need have no apprehension.  Go or stay away, whichever seems best.  But be sure you are on solid spiritual ground before you start and that your motive in going is thoroughly good.  Do not think of what you will get out of the occasion.  Think of what you can bring to it.  But if you are shaky, you had better work with another alcoholic instead!</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Why sit with a long face in places where there is drinking, sighing about the good old days.  If it is a happy occasion, try to increase the pleasure of those there; if a business occasion, go and attend to your business enthusiastically.  If you are with a person who wants to eat in a bar, by all means go along.  Let your friends know they are not to change their habits on your account.  At a proper time and place explain to all your friends why alcohol disagrees with you.  If you do this thoroughly, few people will ask you to drink.  While you were drinking, you were withdrawing from life little by little.  Now you are getting back into the social life of this world.  Don't start to withdraw again just because your friends drink liquor.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Your job now is to be at the place where you may be of maximum helpfulness to others, so never hesitate to go anywhere if you can be helpful.  You should not hesitate to visit the most sordid spot on earth on such an errand.  Keep on the firing line of life with these motives and God will keep you unharmed.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many of us keep liquor in our homes.  We often need it to carry green recruits through a severe hangover  Some of us still serve it to our friends provided they are not alcoholic.  But some of us think we should not serve liquor to anyone.  We never argue this question.</P>
