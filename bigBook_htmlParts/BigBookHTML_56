<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our friend was a minister's son.  He attended church school, where he became rebellious at what he thought an overdose of religious education.  For years thereafter he was dogged by trouble and frustration.  Business failure, insanity, fatal illness, suicide - these calamities in his immediate family embittered and depressed him.  Post-war disillusionment, ever more serious alcoholism, impending mental and physical collapse, brought him to the point of self-destruction.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One night, when confined in a hospital, he was approached by an alcoholic who had known a spiritual experience.  Our friend's gorge rose as he bitterly cried out: &quot;If there is a God, He certainly hasn't done anything for me!&quot; But later, alone in his room, he asked himself this question: &quot;Is it possible that all the religious people I have known are wrong?&quot; While pondering the answer he felt as though he lived in hell.  Then, like a thunderbolt, a great thought came.  It crowded out all else:</P>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Who are you to say there is no God?&quot;</P>
</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This man recounts that he tumbled out of bed to his knees.  In a few seconds he was overwhelmed by a conviction of the Presence of God.  It poured over and through him with the certainty and majesty of a great tide at flood.  The barriers he had built through the years were swept away.  He stood in the Presence of Infinite Power and Love.  He had stepped from bridge to shore.  For the first time, he lived in conscious companionship with his Creator.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thus was our friend's cornerstone fixed in place.  No later vicissitude has shaken it.  His alcoholic problem was taken away.  That very night, years ago, it disappeared.</P>
