<P align=right>Page 68</P></font><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> we think fear ought to be classed with stealing.  It seems to cause more trouble.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We reviewed our fears thoroughly.  We put them on paper, even though we had no resentment in connection with them.  We asked ourselves why we had them.  Wasn't it because self-reliance failed us?  Self-reliance was good as far as it went, but it didn't go far enough.  Some of us once had great self-confidence, but it didn't fully solve the fear problem, or any other.  When it made us cocky, it was worse.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Perhaps there is a better way - we think so.  For we are now on a different basis; the basis of trusting and relying upon God.  We trust infinite God rather than our finite selves.  We are in the world to play the role He assigns.  Just to the extent that we do as we think He would have us, and humbly rely on Him, does He enable us to match calamity with serenity.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We never apologize to anyone for depending upon our Creator.  We can laugh at those who think spirituality the way of weakness.  Paradoxically, it is the way of strength.  The verdict of the ages is that faith means courage.  All men of faith have courage.  They trust their God.  We never apologize for God.  Instead we let Him demonstrate, through us, what He can do.  We ask Him to remove our fear and direct our attention to what He would have us be.  At once, we commence to outgrow fear.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Now about sex.  Many of us needed an overhauling there.  But above all, we tried to be sensible on this question.  It's so easy to get way off the track.  Here we find human opinions running to extremes - absurd extremes, perhaps.  One set of voices cry that sex is a lust of our lower nature, a base necessity of procreation.</P><P align=right><a href="Page_69.htm"><img src="next.gif" alt="Next Page" border="0" width="67" height="21"></A></P></body></HTML>
