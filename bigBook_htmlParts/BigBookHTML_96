<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Do not be discouraged if your prospect does not respond at once.  Search out another alcoholic and try again.  You are sure to find someone desperate enough to accept with eagerness what you offer.  We find it a waste of time to keep chasing a man who cannot or will not work with you.  If you leave such a person alone, he may soon become convinced that he cannot recover by himself.  To spend too much time on any one situation is to deny some other alcoholic an opportunity to live and be happy.  One of our Fellowship failed entirely with his first half dozen prospects.  He often says that if he had continued to work on them, he might have deprived many others, who have since recovered, of their chance.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Suppose now you are making your second visit to a man.  He has read this volume and says he is prepared to go through with the Twelve Steps of the program of recovery.  Having had the experience yourself, you can give him much practical advice.  Let him know you are available if he wishes to make a decision and tell his story, but do not insist upon it if he prefers to consult someone else.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He may be broke and homeless.  If he is, you might try to help him about getting a job, or give him a little financial assistance.  But you should not deprive your family or creditors of money they should have.  Perhaps you will want to take the man into your home for a few days.  But be sure you use discretion.  Be certain he will be welcomed by your family, and that he is not trying to impose upon you for money, connections, or shelter.  Permit that and you only harm him.  You will be making it possible for him to be insincere.</P>
