My old manner of life was by no means a bad one, but I would not exchange its best moments for the worst I have now.  I would not go back to it even if I could.&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fred's story speaks for itself.  We hope it strikes home to thousands like him.  He had felt only the first nip of the wringer.  Most alcoholics have to be pretty badly mangled before they really commence to solve their problems.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many doctors and psychiatrists agree with our conclusions.  One of these men, staff member of a world-renowned hospital, recently made this statement to some of us: &quot;What you say about the general hopelessness of the average alcoholic's plight is, in my opinion, correct.  As to two of you men, whose stories I have heard, there is no doubt in my mind that you were 100% hopeless, apart from divine help.  Had you offered yourselves as patients at this hospital, I would not have taken you, if I had been able to avoid it.  People like you are too heartbreaking.  Though not a religious person, I have profound respect for the spiritual approach in such cases as yours.  For most cases, there is virtually no other solution.&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Once more: The alcoholic at certain times has no effective mental defense against the first drink.  Except in a few rare cases, neither he nor any other human being can provide such a defense.  His defense must come from a Higher Power.</P>
