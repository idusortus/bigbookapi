<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If he is enthusiastic your cooperation will mean a great deal.  If he is lukewarm or thinks he is not an alcoholic, we suggest you leave him alone.  Avoid urging him to follow our program.  The seed has been planted in his mind.  He knows that thousands of men, much like himself, have recovered.  But don't remind him of this after he had been drinking, for he may be angry.  Sooner or later, you are likely to find him reading the book once more.  Wait until repeated stumbling convinces him he must act, for the more you hurry him the longer his recovery may be delayed.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you have a number three husband, you may be in luck.  Being certain he wants to stop, you can go to him with this volume as joyfully as though you had struck oil.  He may not share your enthusiasm, but he is practically sure to read the book and he may go for the program at once.  If he does not, you will probably not have long to wait.  Again, you should not crowd him.  Let him decide for himself.  Cheerfully see him through more sprees.  Talk about his condition or this book only when he raises the issue.  In some cases it may be better to let someone outside the family present the book.  They can urge action without arousing hostility.  If your husband is otherwise a normal individual, your chances are good at this stage.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You would suppose that men in the fourth classification would be quite hopeless, but that is not so.  Many of Alcoholics Anonymous were like that.  Everybody had given them up.  Defeat seemed certain.  Yet often such men had spectacular and powerful recoveries.</P><P align=right><a href="Page_114.htm"><img src="next.gif" alt="Next Page" border="0" width="67" height="21"></A></P></body></HTML>
