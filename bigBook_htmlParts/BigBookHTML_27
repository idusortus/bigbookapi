<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some of our alcoholic readers may think they can do without spiritual help.  Let us tell you the rest of the  conversation our friend had with his doctor.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The doctor said: &quot;You have the mind of a chronic alcoholic.  I have never seen one single case recover, where that state of mind existed to the extent that it does in you.&quot; Our friend felt as though the gates of hell had closed on him with a clang.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He said to the doctor, &quot;Is there no exception?&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Yes,&quot; replied the doctor, &quot;there is.  Exceptions to cases such as yours have been occurring since early times.  Here and there, once in a while, alcoholics have had what are called vital spiritual experiences.  To me these occurrences are phenomena.  They appear to be in the nature of huge emotional displacements and rearrangements.  Ideas, emotions, and attitudes which were once the guiding forces of the lives of these men are suddenly cast to one side, and a completely new set of conceptions and motives begin to dominate them.  In fact, I have been trying to produce some such emotional rearrangement within you.  With many individuals the methods which I employed are successful, but I have never been successful with an alcoholic of your description.&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Upon hearing this, our friend was somewhat relieved, for he reflected that, after all, he was a good church  member.  This hope, however, was destroyed by the doctor's telling him that while his religious convictions were very good, in his case they did not spell the necessary vital spiritual experience.</P>
