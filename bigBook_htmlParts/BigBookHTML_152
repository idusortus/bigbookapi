<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> we smile at such a sally.  We know our friend is like a boy whistling in the dark to keep up his spirits.  He fools himself.  Inwardly he would give anything to take half a dozen drinks and get away with them.  He will presently try the old game again, for he isn't happy about his sobriety.  He cannot picture life without alcohol.  Some day he will be unable to imagine life either with alcohol or without it.  Then he will know loneliness such as few do.  He will be at the jumping-off place.  He will wish for the end.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have shown how we got out from under.  You say, &quot;Yes, I'm willing.  But am I to be consigned to a life where I shall be stupid, boring and glum, like some righteous people I see?  I know I must get along without liquor, but how can I?  Have you a sufficient substitute?&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yes, there is a substitute and it is vastly more than that.  It is a fellowship in Alcoholics Anonymous.  There you will find release from care, boredom and worry.  Your imagination will be fired.  Life will mean something at last.  The most satisfactory years of your existence lie ahead.  Thus we find the fellowship, and so will you.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;How is that to come about?&quot; you ask. &quot;Where am I to find these people?&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You are going to meet these new friends in your own community.  Near you, alcoholics are dying helplessly like people in a sinking ship.  If you live in a large place, there are hundreds.  High and low, rich and poor, these are future fellows of Alcoholics Anonymous.  Among them you will make lifelong friends.  You will be bound to them with new and wonderful ties, for you will escape disaster together and you will</P>
