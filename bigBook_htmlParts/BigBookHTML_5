<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I became an unwelcome hanger-on at brokerage places.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Liquor ceased to be a luxury; it became a necessity. &quot;Bathtub&quot; gin, two bottles a day, and often three, got to be routine.  Sometimes a small deal would net a few hundred dollars, and I would pay my bills at the bars and delicatessens.
