    <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> powerful! Without help it is too much for us. But there 
      is One who has all power-that One is God. May you find Him now!</P>
    <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Half measures availed us nothing. We stood at the turning 
      point. We asked His protection and care with complete abandon.</P>
    <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Here are the steps we took, which are suggested as a program 
      of recovery:</P>
    <OL compact>
      <LI>We admitted we were powerless over alcohol &#151; that our lives had 
        become unmanageable. 
      <LI>Came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could restore us 
        to sanity. 
      <LI>Made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of God 
        <I>as we understood Him.</I> 
      <LI>Made a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves. 
      <LI>Admitted to God, to ourselves, and to another human being the exact 
        nature of our wrongs. 
      <LI>Were entirely ready to have God remove all these defects of character. 
      <LI>Humbly asked Him to remove our shortcomings. 
      <LI>Made a list of all persons we had harmed, and became willing to make 
        amends to them all. 
      <LI>Made direct amends to such people wherever possible, except when to 
        do so would injure them or others. 
      <LI>Continued to take personal inventory and when we were wrong promptly 
        admitted it. 
      <LI>Sought through prayer and meditation to improve our conscious contact 
        with God <I>as we understood Him,</I> praying only for knowledge of His 
        will for us and the power to carry that out.
